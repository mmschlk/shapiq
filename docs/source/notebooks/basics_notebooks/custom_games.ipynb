    "## Introduction to Cooperative Game Theory and Shapley Values\n",
    "Cooperative game theory deals with the study of games in which players/participants can form groups (also known coalitions) to achieve a collective payoff. More formally a cooperative game is defined as a tuple $(N,\\nu)$ where:\n",
    "- $N$ is a finite set of players\n",
    "- $\\nu$ is a characteristic function that maps every coalition of players to a real number, i.e. $\\nu:2^N \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining a Custom Cooperative Game\n",
    "To illustrate the concept of cooperative games, we consider a simple example of a _cooking game_ you might find in a restaurant.\n",
    "The game consists of three cooks, _Alice_, _Bob_, and _Charlie_, who are preparing a meal _together_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The characteristic function $\\nu$ maps each coalition of players to the quality of the meal:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Coalition             | Quality |\n",
    "|-----------------------|---------|\n",
    "| {no cook}             | 0       |\n",
    "| {Alice}               | 4       |\n",
    "| {Bob}                 | 3       |\n",
    "| {Charlie}             | 2       |\n",
    "| {Alice, Bob}          | 9       |\n",
    "| {Alice, Charlie}      | 8       |\n",
    "| {Bob, Charlie}        | 7       |\n",
    "| {Alice, Bob, Charlie} | 15      |\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the coalition {Alice, Bob} has a quality of 7, while the coalition {Alice, Bob, Charlie} has a quality of 15.\n",
    "If no cooks participate, the quality of the meal is 0 and no meal is prepared.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can easily model this general form of a cooperative game with `shapiq` by defining a class that inherits from the `shapiq.Game` class.\n",
    "Note, a game does not necessarily have to be a subclass of `shapiq.Game` and can also be a simple function that defines the value function $\\nu:2^N \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "Methods in `shapiq` can also be used with such functions. However, using the `Game` class provides a more structured way to define the game and its properties.\n",
    "It also comes equipped with handy helper methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we define the `CookingGame` class that models the cooking game."
