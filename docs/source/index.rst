The ``shapiq`` Python package
================================

Shapley Interaction Quantification (``shapiq``) is a Python package for (1) approximating any-order Shapley interactions, (2) benchmarking game-theoretical algorithms for machine learning, (3) explaining feature interactions of model predictions. ``shapiq`` extends the well-known `shap <https://github.com/shap/shap>`_ package for both researchers working on game theory in machine learning, as well as the end-users explaining models. SHAP-IQ extends indivdual Shapley values by quantifying the **synergy** effect between entities (aka **players** in the jargon of game theory) like explanatory features, data points, or weak learners in ensemble models. Synergies between players give a more comprehensive view of machine learning models.
