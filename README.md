# Technical Supplement: Unifying Feature-Based Explanations with Functional ANOVA and Cooperative Game Theory

This technical supplement is a fork of the `shapiq` python library.
**Do not use this fork for any other purpose than the technical supplement**, as some bug fixes and features are not included in this fork.
All relevant scripts and settings for work are in the python files named `framework_*.py`.

- The explanation games are defined in `framework_explanation_game.py` and `framework_explanations.py`.
- The computation of the explanations for the synthetic data is defined in `framework_compute_explanations_synth.py`, `framework_pre_compute_synth_local.py`, and `framework_plot_explanations.py`.
- The ML real-world examples are provided in `framework_examples_ml.py`.
