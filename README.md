# Technical Supplement: Unifying Feature-Based Explanations with Functional ANOVA and Cooperative Game Theory

This technical supplement is a fork of the `shapiq` python library.
Do not use this fork for any other purpose than the technical supplement, as some bug fixes and features are not included in this fork.
All relevant scripts and settings for work are in the python files named `framework_*.py`.

- The explanation games are defined in `framework_explanation_game.py` and `framework_explanations.py`.
- The computation of the explanations for the synthetic data is defined in `framework_compute_explanations_synth.py`, `framework_pre_compute_synth_local.py`, and `framework_plot_explanations.py`.
- The ML real-world examples are provided in `framework_examples_ml.py`.
