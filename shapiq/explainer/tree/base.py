class TreeModel:
    """A dataclass for storing the information of a tree model.

    The dataclass stores the information of a tree model in a way that is easy to access and
    manipulate. The dataclass is used to convert tree models from different libraries to a common
    format.

    Attributes:
        children_left: The left children of each node in a tree. Leaf nodes are -1.
        children_right: The right children of each node in a tree. Leaf nodes are -1.
        features: The feature indices of the decision nodes in a tree. Leaf nodes are assumed to be
            -2 but no check is performed.
        thresholds: The thresholds of the decision nodes in a tree. Leaf nodes are set to NaN.
        values: The values of the leaf nodes in a tree.
        node_sample_weight: The sample weights of the nodes in a tree.
        empty_prediction: The empty prediction of the tree model. The default value is None. Then
            the empty prediction is computed from the leaf values and the sample weights.
        leaf_mask: The boolean mask of the leaf nodes in a tree. The default value is None. Then the
            leaf mask is computed from the children left and right arrays.

        For example, consider a tree model with the following feature indices:

            [0, 1, 8]

        The method will remove the unused feature indices and reindex the feature indices of the
        decision nodes in the tree to the following:

        Feature '8' is 'renamed' to '2' such that in the internal representation a one-hot vector
