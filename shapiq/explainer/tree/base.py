class TreeModel:
    """A dataclass for storing the information of a tree model.

    The dataclass stores the information of a tree model in a way that is easy to access and
    manipulate. The dataclass is used to convert tree models from different libraries to a common
    format.

    Attributes:
        children_left: The left children of each node in a tree. Leaf nodes are ``-1``.
        children_right: The right children of each node in a tree. Leaf nodes are ``-1``.
        features: The feature indices of the decision nodes in a tree. Leaf nodes are assumed to be
            ``-2`` but no check is performed.
        thresholds: The thresholds of the decision nodes in a tree. Leaf nodes are set to ``np.NaN``.
        values: The values of the leaf nodes in a tree.
        node_sample_weight: The sample weights of the nodes in a tree.
        empty_prediction: The empty prediction of the tree model. The default value is ``None`.` Then
            the empty prediction is computed from the leaf values and the sample weights.
        leaf_mask: The boolean mask of the leaf nodes in a tree. The default value is ``None``. Then the
            leaf mask is computed from the children left and right arrays.
        n_features_in_tree: The number of features in the tree model. The default value is ``None``.
            Then the number of features in the tree model is computed from the unique feature
            indices in the features array.
        max_feature_id: The maximum feature index in the tree model. The default value is ``None``. Then
            the maximum feature index in the tree model is computed from the features array.
        feature_ids: The feature indices of the decision nodes in the tree model. The default value
            is ``None``. Then the feature indices of the decision nodes in the tree model are computed
            from the unique feature indices in the features array.
        root_node_id: The root node id of the tree model. The default value is ``None``. Then the root
            node id of the tree model is set to ``0``.
        n_nodes: The number of nodes in the tree model. The default value is ``None``. Then the number
            of nodes in the tree model is computed from the children left array.
        nodes: The node ids of the tree model. The default value is ``None``. Then the node ids of the
            tree model are computed from the number of nodes in the tree model.
        feature_map_original_internal: A mapping of feature indices from the original feature
            indices (as in the model) to the internal feature indices (as in the tree model).
        feature_map_internal_original: A mapping of feature indices from the internal feature
            indices (as in the tree model) to the original feature indices (as in the model).
        original_output_type: The original output type of the tree model. The default value is
            ``"raw"``.
