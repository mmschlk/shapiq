    """The FeatureSelection game.

    The `FeatureSelectionGame` is a game that evaluates the goodness of fit of a model on a subset
    of features. The goodness of fit is determined by a score or loss function that compares the
    model's test set performance.

    Args:
        x_train: The training data used to fit the model. Should be a 2d matrix of shape
            (n_samples, n_features).
        y_train: The training labels used to fit the model. Can be a 1d or 2d matrix of shape
            (n_samples, n_outputs).
        x_test: The test data used to evaluate the model. Should be the same shape as `x_train`.
        y_test: The test labels used to evaluate the model. Should be the same shape as `y_train`.
        fit_function: The function that fits the model to the training data. It should take the
            training data and labels as input.
        score_function: The function that scores the model's performance on the test data. It should
            take the test data and labels as input. If not provided, then `predict_function` and
            `loss_function` must be provided.
        predict_function: The function that predicts the test labels given the test data. It should
            take the test data as input. If not provided, then `score_function` must be provided.
        loss_function: The function that computes the loss between the predicted and true test
            labels. It should take the true and predicted test labels as input. If not provided,
            then `score_function` must be provided.
        normalize: A flag to normalize the game values. If `True`, then the game values are
            normalized and centered to be zero for the empty set of features. Defaults to `True`.
        empty_features_value: The worth of an empty subset of features. Defaults to 0.0.

    Attributes:
        empty_features_value: The value to return when the subset of features is empty.
