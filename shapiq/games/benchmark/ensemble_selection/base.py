    """The Ensemble Selection game.

    The ensemble selection game models ensemble selection problems as cooperative games. The players
    are ensemble members and the value of a coalition is the performance of the ensemble on a
    test set.

    Note:
        Depending on the ensemble members, this game requires the `scikit-learn` and `xgboost` packages.

    Args:
        x_train: The training data as a numpy array of shape (n_samples, n_features).
        y_train: The training labels as a numpy array of shape (n_samples,).
        x_test: The test data as a numpy array of shape (n_samples, n_features).
        y_test: The test labels as a numpy array of shape (n_samples,).
        loss_function: The loss function to use for the ensemble members as a callable expecting
            two arguments: y_true and y_pred and returning a float.
        dataset_type: The type of dataset. Available dataset types are 'classification' and
            'regression'. Defaults to 'classification'.
        ensemble_members: A optional list of ensemble members to use. Defaults to None. If None,
            then the ensemble members are determined by the game. Available ensemble members are
            - 'regression' (will use linear regression for regression datasets and logistic
                regression for classification datasets)
            - 'decision_tree'
            - 'random_forest'
            - 'gradient_boosting'
            - 'knn'
            - 'svm'
        n_members: The number of ensemble members to use. Defaults to 10. Ignored if
            `ensemble_members` is not None.
        verbose: Whether to print information about the game and the ensemble members. Defaults to
            True.
        normalize: Whether to normalize the game values. Defaults to True.
        random_state: The random state to use for the ensemble members. Defaults to 42.
