    """An Imputer for TabPFN using the Remove-and-Contextualize paradigm.

    The remove-and-contextualize paradigm is a strategy to explain the predictions of a TabPFN [2]_
    model which uses in-context learning for prediction. Instead of imputing missing features, the
    TabPFNImputer removes feature columns missing in a coalition from training data and re-"trains"
    re-contextualizes the model with the remaining features. The model is then used to predict the
    data point which is also missing the features. This pardigm is described in Rundel et al.
    (2024) [1]_.

    Attributes:
        x_train: The training data to contextualize the model on.
        y_train: The training labels to contextualize the model on.
        empty_prediction: The model's average prediction on an empty data point.

                trained but the correct train data with the correct features per coalition are put

                but the correct train data and labels are put into TabPFN's context.
