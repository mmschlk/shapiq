class Game(ABC):
    """Base class for games/benchmarks in the ``shapiq`` package.

    This class implements some common methods and attributes that all games should have.

    Args:
        n_players: The number of players in the game.
        normalize: Whether the game values should be normalized. Defaults to ``True``.
        normalization_value: The value to normalize and center the game values with such that the
            value for the empty coalition is zero. Defaults to ``None``.  If ``normalization`` is set
            to ``False`` this value is not required. Otherwise, the value is needed to normalize and
            center the game. If no value is provided, the game raises a warning.
        path_to_values: The path to load the game values from. If the path is provided, the game
            values are loaded from the given path. Defaults to ``None``.
        verbose: Whether to show a progress bar for the evaluation. Defaults to ``False``. Note
            that this only has an effect if the game is not precomputed and may slow down the
            evaluation.
        args, kwargs: Additional arguments are not used.

    Properties:
        n_values_stored: The number of values stored in the game.
        precomputed: Indication whether the game has been precomputed.
        normalize: Indication whether the game values are normalized.
        game_name: The name of the game.

    Attributes:
        precompute_flag: A flag to manually override the precomputed check. If set to ``True``, the
            game is considered precomputed and only uses the lookup.
        value_storage: The storage for the game values without normalization applied.
        coalition_lookup: A lookup dictionary mapping from coalitions to indices in the
            ``value_storage``.
        n_players: The number of players in the game.
        normalization_value: The value to normalize and center the game values with.
        empty_coalition: The empty coalition of the game.
        grand_coalition: The grand coalition of the game.
        verbose: Whether to show a progress bar for the evaluation.

    Note:
        This class is a base class and all games should inherit from this class and implement the
        `value_function` methods. Only use this class directly for dealing with precomputed games.
