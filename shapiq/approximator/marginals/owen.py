class OwenSamplingSV(Approximator):
    """Owen Sampling approximator for the Shapley values.

    The Owen Sampling algorithm estimates the Shapley values (SV) by sampling random marginal
    contributions for each player and each coalition size. The marginal contributions are used to
    update an integral representation of the SV. For more information, see [Okh20]_.
    The number of anchor points M at which the integral is to be palpated share the available budget
    for each player equally. A higher `n_anchor_points` increases the resolution of the integral
    reducing bias while reducing the accuracy of the estimation at each point.

    Attributes:
        n: The number of players.
        iteration_cost: The cost of a single iteration of the approximator.
