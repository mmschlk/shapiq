    r"""Implements the Gaussian copula-based approach for imputation according to [Aas21]_.

    This method models feature dependence using a Gaussian copula, separating the modeling of marginal distributions
    from their joint dependence structure. Each feature is first transformed to follow a standard normal distribution by
    applying the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF), followed by the standard normal quantile function.

    Monte Carlo samples are then drawn from the conditional multivariate normal distribution in this transformed (Gaussian)
    space, given the observed values in a coalition. These samples are finally transformed back to the original feature space
    using the inverse of the empirical CDFs.
