So that¬¥s what I called a bad bad film,10,1532
This was the worst movie I've ever seen in theaters,12,1533
Ripping this movie apart is like shooting fish in a barrel,11,1534
This is exactly the reason why many people remain homeless ,10,1535
Little Man now on DVD is a Wayans Brothers flop,11,1536
This is a simple tale but it feels very manipulative,12,1537
I can see the guys doing the budget preparation for this flick,12,1538
This movie could have been so much better especially considering the talent,12,1539
Salvage is the worst so called horror film I've ever seen,13,1540
This movie is very important because suggested me this consideration,10,1541
This is by far the worst film I have seen in my entire life,14,1542
First of all the big named actors must need the money,11,1543
From the beginning this movie did have a few flaws,10,1544

It is like what the title of this thread say,10,1550
The Cowboys could leave you a little sore in the saddle,11,1551

I give this movie a ONE for it is truly an awful movie,13,1560
I like silent films but this was a little too moronic,12,1561
This may actually be the worst movie that I have ever scene,12,1562

The acting was horrible and they got both of the sports wrongggg,14,1566
This movie was probably the biggest waste of my life ever,11,1567
The opening scenes move as fluidly as frozen velveeta,13,1568
Kids Like These could have been a decent film given the subject matter,13,1569
They Are Among Us is poor science fiction at best,10,1570

Some very interesting camera work and a story with much potential,11,1572
I bought this movie last weekend at my local Movie Gallery,11,1573
I began watching this movie with my girl-friend,10,1574
Arahan adds nothing positive to the Kung Fu genre,10,1575

If there was a ZERO rating I would give it to this movie,13,1578
I just finished watching this film and WOW was that bad,11,1579
The first few minutes of The Bodyguard do have a campy charm,13,1580
First and foremost I loved the novel by Ray Bradbury,11,1581
This TV-made thriller is all talk little action,10,1582
This is a low budget Roger Corman horror/creature flick,12,1583
Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water,13,1584
A large part of the scenes should be cut off,10,1585
I'm a big fan of Lucio Fulci,12,1586

If you want to see women's breasts get a porno,13,1588

As much as I love Rodney Dangerfield this was a terrible movie,13,1590

is seismic activity with little or negligible results on the surface,13,1592
I'm not even gonna waste time on this one,11,1593
Movie didn't have much plot and was uninteresting,13,1594
This is an abysmal piece of story-telling,11,1595
What can possibly said about this movie other than viewer beware,12,1596

Russell Hopton acted in many films until his death in 1945,12,1610
One more of extremely unprofessional movies about computer programmers,13,1611
Five minutes into this movie you realize that you have seen it all before,14,1612
the lowest score possible is one star? that's a shame,13,1613
I really do fail to see the actual surplus value of this movie,13,1614

I rented this DVD having seen it while looking for something else,12,1628
This film has a very simple but somehow very bad plot,11,1629
This series was CBS networks answer to the success of the Big Valley,13,1630
This is another example of a sucky sequel to a great movie,13,1631
Where is it written that sequels must suck? Scream 2 didn't,14,1632
I saw Brigadoon on TV last night (12 Sept 2009),14,1633
Superficically Brigadoon is a very promising entertainment package,13,1634
Have to admit this version disgraces Shakespeare upfront,10,1635
Good films cannot solely be based on a beautiful garden and a hill top,14,1636
I'll have to add dissenting comment here,10,1637
I think Cliff Robertson certainly was one of our finest actors,11,1638
If this is someone's favorite movie they need some serious help,13,1639

Slackers is just another teen movie that's not really worth watching,14,1650

This centers on unironic notions of coming to grips with guilt,13,1652
I'll just be vague about my potential spoiling comments,12,1653
If you hate redneck accents you'll hate this movie,12,1654
I respect the fact that this is a very popular show,11,1655

I went to see this with my wife and 3 yr old son,14,1657

Phew--I don't what to say,11,1692
Oh Sam Mraovich we know you tried so hard,11,1693

There's no getting around it-- this movie is terrible,13,1695

This is not an all-around terrible comedy but it is very DULL,14,1697

Man even Plan 9 From Outer Space is better than this movie,12,1716
This movie is unworthy of the Omen title,10,1717
Only the Antichrist could have been behind such a disaster,11,1718
The fact that I watched this entire movie says something about it,12,1719
I saw the omen when i was 11 on tv,11,1720
Omen IV (1991) was a bad made-for-T,14,1721
This sequel is a total rehash of the first film,12,1722
To the small minority seen here praising this film GET SERIOUS,11,1723
On the surface the idea of Omen 4 was good,11,1724
If you are hoping for ANYTHING new you have chosen the wrong movie,13,1725
Pointless short about a bunch of half naked men slapping and punching each other,14,1726
We've all seen this story a hundred times,10,1727

Really truly abysmally garishly awful,10,1754
The number of goofs in this episode was higher than the first 9,14,1755
This appalling film somehow saw the light of day in 1988,13,1756
From the moment the film begins already there is a discrepancy,14,1757
Robert Colomb has two full-time jobs,10,1758
I registered for IMDb just to comment on this movie,11,1759
I've seen the movie only recently although it appeared in 2001,13,1760
This movie is horrible if you pay attention to it,10,1761
That is the only thing I can positive to say about this movie,13,1762
Not totally off the wall in a good way but just totally stupid,13,1763
This is loosely based on the ideas of the original 80's hit ,14,1764
I'll try to use words to describe this on,11,1765
I can't believe I watched this expecting more,10,1766
When I saw the commercial for this I was all about seeing it,13,1767
Best of the Best 4 is better than 3 but just barely,12,1768

This movie is one of the most wildly distorted portrayals of history,13,1785
I don't think this movie was rated correctly,10,1786
There are a lot of highly talented filmmakers/actors in Germany now,13,1787
I guess I have still enough brain left to NOT find this movie funny,14,1788
Otto Preminger directs this light as a feather story,10,1789
Jean Seberg had not one iota of acting talent,11,1790
Greenaway's films pose as clever erudite and innovative,13,1791
Stilted stagy strange and opaque if visually striking ,11,1792
Greenaway seems to have a habit of trying deliberately to disgust his viewers,14,1793
somewhere i'd read that this film is supposed to be a comedy,14,1794

This is one horror movie based TV show that gets it right,12,3429

Throughly enjoy all the musical numbers each time I see this movie,13,3450

World At War is perhaps the greatest documentary series of all time,12,3488

As so many others have written this is a wonderful documentary,11,3490
The world at war is one of the best documentaries about world war 2,14,3491

I'm going to keep this review short and sweet,11,3511
I've seen this movie when I was traveling in Brazil,12,3512

The tweedy professor-types thought they had it all figured out,13,3514
The Invisible man is a show everybody s gotta love,10,3515

The first thing I have to say is that I own Jake Speed,13,3519
Jake Speed is a fine movie with a wonderful message,10,3520
I know the film snobs are snorting,10,3521

The movie was much better than the other reviewer stated,10,3563
I found 'Time At The Top' an entertaining and stimulating experience,13,3564
One of the more intelligent serial killer movies in recent history,11,3565

Douglas Sirk directs this over-acted drama about the unhappy affluent,13,3708

Where do I start? First off the story sucks,10,6697
I just found out before writing this review that Komodo vs,13,6698
Laughable would be a good term to describe this movie,11,6699
Cheap gloriously bad cheese from the 80's the decade of cheese,14,6700
All right there's no way to sugarcoat this,11,6701
Well this movie actually did have one redeeming quality,11,6702
This has to be the most boring movie I ever sat through,12,6703
I found this to be a watchable all be it very predictable movie,14,6704
I did have a good time the first 45 min,10,6705
Badly shot badly edited clumsy dialogue flat characters unsuccessful adaption of a novel,14,6706
I knew it was going to be awful but not this awful,12,6707
I rented this movie because I am a huge Dudikoff fan,13,6708
I really should have learned more about this movie before renting it,13,6709
Well i thought the movie was blah 1/10,10,6710
I think that this was one of the most trite films ever made,14,6711
A horrendous film ill-conceived and crude,11,6712
A remake of a successful movie can be a tricky business at best,13,6713
This is one of the dumbest ideas for a movie,11,6714
Norm(an)ally I don't mind remakes,12,6715
Dodgy plot dodgy script dodgy almost everything in fact,12,6716
No gore no blood no gratifying death scenes,10,6717
This movie gives a cinematic example of the word worthless,10,6718
This has to be one of the all time greatest horror movies,12,6719
This movie was included in the Six Wives of Henry VIII BBC miniseries DVD,14,6720
I can't express enough just how bad this film was,12,6721
This is another film I missed out on Italian TV as a kid,13,6722
Hmmm not a patch on the original from Shaw Brothers,11,6723
I rented a copy of this one from Netflix -- big mistake,13,6724
It would be quite easy to make this movie sound fun,11,6725
Every time I've seen this movie I get the same impression,13,6726
This is without question one of the worst movies I have ever seen,13,6727
Like most musicals of the era one must check reality at the door,13,6728
This movie looked like it was rushed to release for some reason,12,6729

My wife and I couldn't even finish the film,11,6735

I go this game and it is alright I guess,10,6741
OK lets get one thing straight i love dinosaur movies even the bad ones,14,6742
This is one heck of a sleazy film,10,6743
The title pretty much lets you know what you're getting,12,6744
Well that's what this should have been called anyway,11,6745
Ted Nicolaou made a lot of great horror and fantasy films,12,6746
Obviously someone was looking at catching onto the Blair Witch wave,11,6747
Only a very small child could overlook the absurdities in this bomb,13,6748
I think Walter Pidgeon was badly miscast in this film,13,6749
I saw this movie when it was first released in 1986,11,6750

This is one of the strangest things on TV,10,6752
Everyone has their choice for worst movie they've ever seen,12,6753
This sequel to Problem Child is just as bad as the first one,13,6754

There is only one word to define the whole movie that is,12,6769
How bad idea was to remake an almost Oscar -worthy film?,13,6770
I hesitated seeing this movie having really enjoyed the original 'Mostly Martha',14,6771
Critics have started calling it the Oscar Winner club understandably,11,6772
Started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters,13,6773
This was an attempt toward a romantic comedy and one which did not work,14,6774

The worst film I have seen in the last 12 months,11,6778

The horrific production doesn't qualify as a film,10,6780
This is a serious film about black revolutionaries and not really an action film,14,6781
I must give credit to Billy Dee for trying to pull this off,13,6782
Well great costumes and a wonderful `feel' for Pre WWII Italy,13,6783

It's About Time Kate Jackson got her credit for this film,13,7765

The first movie at the Fangoria Festival in Vegas and the most challenging,14,7799
