So that´s what I called a bad bad film,10,1532
This was the worst movie I've ever seen in theaters,12,1533
Ripping this movie apart is like shooting fish in a barrel,11,1534
This is exactly the reason why many people remain homeless ,10,1535
Little Man now on DVD is a Wayans Brothers flop,11,1536
This is a simple tale but it feels very manipulative,12,1537
I can see the guys doing the budget preparation for this flick,12,1538
This movie could have been so much better especially considering the talent,12,1539
Salvage is the worst so called horror film I've ever seen,13,1540
This movie is very important because suggested me this consideration,10,1541
This is by far the worst film I have seen in my entire life,14,1542
First of all the big named actors must need the money,11,1543
From the beginning this movie did have a few flaws,10,1544

It is like what the title of this thread say,10,1550
The Cowboys could leave you a little sore in the saddle,11,1551

I give this movie a ONE for it is truly an awful movie,13,1560
I like silent films but this was a little too moronic,12,1561
This may actually be the worst movie that I have ever scene,12,1562

Kids Like These could have been a decent film given the subject matter,13,1569
They Are Among Us is poor science fiction at best,10,1570

I bought this movie last weekend at my local Movie Gallery,11,1573
I began watching this movie with my girl-friend,10,1574
Arahan adds nothing positive to the Kung Fu genre,10,1575

If there was a ZERO rating I would give it to this movie,13,1578
I just finished watching this film and WOW was that bad,11,1579
The first few minutes of The Bodyguard do have a campy charm,13,1580
First and foremost I loved the novel by Ray Bradbury,11,1581
This TV-made thriller is all talk little action,10,1582
This is a low budget Roger Corman horror/creature flick,12,1583
Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water,13,1584
A large part of the scenes should be cut off,10,1585
I'm a big fan of Lucio Fulci,12,1586

If you want to see women's breasts get a porno,13,1588

As much as I love Rodney Dangerfield this was a terrible movie,13,1590

is seismic activity with little or negligible results on the surface,13,1592
I'm not even gonna waste time on this one,11,1593
Movie didn't have much plot and was uninteresting,13,1594
This is an abysmal piece of story-telling,11,1595
What can possibly said about this movie other than viewer beware,12,1596

Russell Hopton acted in many films until his death in 1945,12,1610
One more of extremely unprofessional movies about computer programmers,13,1611
Five minutes into this movie you realize that you have seen it all before,14,1612
the lowest score possible is one star? that's a shame,13,1613
I really do fail to see the actual surplus value of this movie,13,1614

This film has a very simple but somehow very bad plot,11,1629
This series was CBS networks answer to the success of the Big Valley,13,1630
This is another example of a sucky sequel to a great movie,13,1631
Where is it written that sequels must suck? Scream 2 didn't,14,1632
I saw Brigadoon on TV last night (12 Sept 2009),14,1633
Superficically Brigadoon is a very promising entertainment package,13,1634
Have to admit this version disgraces Shakespeare upfront,10,1635
Good films cannot solely be based on a beautiful garden and a hill top,14,1636
I'll have to add dissenting comment here,10,1637
I think Cliff Robertson certainly was one of our finest actors,11,1638
If this is someone's favorite movie they need some serious help,13,1639

Slackers is just another teen movie that's not really worth watching,14,1650

This centers on unironic notions of coming to grips with guilt,13,1652
I'll just be vague about my potential spoiling comments,12,1653
If you hate redneck accents you'll hate this movie,12,1654
I respect the fact that this is a very popular show,11,1655

I went to see this with my wife and 3 yr old son,14,1657

Oh Sam Mraovich we know you tried so hard,11,1693

There's no getting around it-- this movie is terrible,13,1695

This is not an all-around terrible comedy but it is very DULL,14,1697

Man even Plan 9 From Outer Space is better than this movie,12,1716
This movie is unworthy of the Omen title,10,1717
Only the Antichrist could have been behind such a disaster,11,1718
The fact that I watched this entire movie says something about it,12,1719
I saw the omen when i was 11 on tv,11,1720
Omen IV (1991) was a bad made-for-T,14,1721
This sequel is a total rehash of the first film,12,1722
To the small minority seen here praising this film GET SERIOUS,11,1723
On the surface the idea of Omen 4 was good,11,1724
If you are hoping for ANYTHING new you have chosen the wrong movie,13,1725
Pointless short about a bunch of half naked men slapping and punching each other,14,1726

Really truly abysmally garishly awful,10,1754
The number of goofs in this episode was higher than the first 9,14,1755
This appalling film somehow saw the light of day in 1988,13,1756
From the moment the film begins already there is a discrepancy,14,1757
Robert Colomb has two full-time jobs,10,1758
I registered for IMDb just to comment on this movie,11,1759
I've seen the movie only recently although it appeared in 2001,13,1760
This movie is horrible if you pay attention to it,10,1761
That is the only thing I can positive to say about this movie,13,1762
Not totally off the wall in a good way but just totally stupid,13,1763
This is loosely based on the ideas of the original 80's hit ,14,1764
I'll try to use words to describe this on,11,1765
I can't believe I watched this expecting more,10,1766
When I saw the commercial for this I was all about seeing it,13,1767

This movie is one of the most wildly distorted portrayals of history,13,1785
I don't think this movie was rated correctly,10,1786
There are a lot of highly talented filmmakers/actors in Germany now,13,1787
I guess I have still enough brain left to NOT find this movie funny,14,1788
Otto Preminger directs this light as a feather story,10,1789
Jean Seberg had not one iota of acting talent,11,1790
Greenaway's films pose as clever erudite and innovative,13,1791
Stilted stagy strange and opaque if visually striking ,11,1792
Greenaway seems to have a habit of trying deliberately to disgust his viewers,14,1793
somewhere i'd read that this film is supposed to be a comedy,14,1794

So Fox pulled the plug midway through a drama/mystery,11,3743

I think I am some kind of Road Runner fan,10,7801
This cartoon documents the second encounter between Wile E,10,7802
